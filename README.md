# Aquas-game-art-pack
The code for the sprites is fairly simple , I made a few buttons for each sub category of the type of art: -Player [art] -Textures [art] -Items [art] Then I made it so if you click them they will show that type of art , using some sub code under the "if else" "When I receive (button1/player)" +show -hide "When + Clicked" Forever: wait: (0.5 seconds) Next [costume] this is the same for all the art but the wait value changes.
